## 🔍 Key Findings from Automated Tests

### Design Token Verification Results

**Total Issues:** 127 hardcoded values detected

**Breakdown:**
- Auth.css: 64 issues (needs migration)
- Dashboard.css: 27 issues (some updates needed)
- Profile.css: 3 issues (minor)
- Ranking.css: 2 issues (minor)
- Admin.css: 4 issues (minor)
- Design system files: 27 issues (mostly acceptable)

**Note:** Many "issues" are actually acceptable:
- Breakpoint values (standard practice)
- Touch target sizes (44px - accessibility requirement)
- Focus outline widths (3px - accessibility requirement)

**Action Items:**
1. High Priority: Migrate Auth.css to design tokens
2. Medium Priority: Update Dashboard.css where appropriate
3. Low Priority: Consider adding gradient tokens for Profile.css
