/**
 * Legacy CSS Overrides
 * 
 * Temporary overrides for safe migration. This file should be used sparingly
 * and only for emergency fixes during the CSS refactoring process.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: All rules in this file should be temporary and documented with:
 * - TODO comment explaining what needs to be fixed
 * - Issue/ticket number for tracking
 * - Timeline for proper fix
 * 
 * Example:
 * TODO: Refactor button component to use proper BEM classes - Issue #123
 * Timeline: Remove by end of sprint
 * .emergency-button-fix {
 *   // temporary override
 * }

/* 
 * This file is intentionally empty at the start of the migration.
 * Add temporary overrides here only when absolutely necessary.
