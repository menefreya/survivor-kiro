## Common Issues & Solutions

### CSS Custom Properties
**Issue**: Not supported in older browsers
**Solution**: Provide fallback values
```css
color: #FF6B35; /* Fallback */
color: var(--color-primary);
```

### Backdrop Filter
**Issue**: Limited browser support
**Solution**: Use @supports with fallback
```css
.navigation {
  background: rgba(10, 10, 11, 0.95); /* Fallback */
}

@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {
  .navigation {
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  }
}
```

### CSS Grid
**Issue**: IE11 has different implementation
**Solution**: Use @supports with flexbox fallback
```css
.grid-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  }
}
```

### Mobile Viewport Issues
**Issue**: Content zooms on input focus (iOS)
**Solution**: Set font-size to 16px minimum
```css
.form-input {
  font-size: 16px; /* Prevents zoom on iOS */
}
```

### Touch Interactions
**Issue**: Default touch behaviors interfere
**Solution**: Use touch-action and disable highlights
```css
.interactive-element {
  touch-action: manipulation;
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

## Testing Schedule

### Pre-Release Testing
1. **Development Phase**: Test in primary browser (Chrome)
2. **Feature Complete**: Test in all desktop browsers
3. **Pre-Production**: Test on mobile devices
4. **Final QA**: Complete cross-browser testing

### Post-Release Monitoring
- Monitor error logs for browser-specific issues
- Check analytics for browser usage patterns
- Gather user feedback on compatibility
- Update browser support as needed

## Browser Support Policy

### Fully Supported
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
