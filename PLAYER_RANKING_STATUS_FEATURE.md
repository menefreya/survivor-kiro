# Player Ranking Status Feature

## Overview
Added a feature to the Admin Dashboard that displays which players have submitted their rankings before the draft is triggered.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `backend/services/draftService.js`
- Added new function `getPlayerRankingStatus()` that returns detailed information about each player's ranking submission status
- Returns player name, email, and submission status
- Exports the new function for use in the controller

#### 2. `backend/controllers/draftController.js`
- Updated `getDraftStatus()` endpoint to include player ranking status
- Now returns:
  - `isComplete`: Whether draft is complete
  - `pickCount`: Number of draft picks
  - `completedAt`: Timestamp of completion
  - `players`: Array of player objects with submission status
  - `totalPlayers`: Total number of players
  - `submittedCount`: Number of players who submitted rankings

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. `frontend/src/components/Admin.jsx`
- Updated Draft Section to display a table of all players with their submission status
- Shows player name, email, and visual status indicator
- Table only displays when draft is not yet complete
- Updated to use new API response structure (`isComplete` instead of `draft_completed`)
- Added visual status badges (✓ Submitted / ⏳ Pending)

#### 4. `frontend/src/styles/Admin.css`
- Added styles for `.player-status-list` and `.player-status-table`
- Added row highlighting:
  - Green background for submitted players
  - Yellow background for pending players
- Added `.status-badge` styles with color-coded indicators
- Made table responsive for mobile devices

## User Experience

### Admin View
When an admin visits the Admin Dashboard:

1. **Before Draft**: The Draft section shows:
   - Draft status (Pending)
   - Count of submitted rankings (e.g., "3 / 5")
   - Table listing all players with:
     - Player name
     - Email address
     - Visual status badge (green checkmark for submitted, yellow clock for pending)
   - Row highlighting for quick visual scanning

2. **After Draft**: The Draft section shows:
   - Draft status (Complete)
   - Completion timestamp
   - No player status table (no longer needed)

## API Response Example

```json
{
  "isComplete": false,
  "pickCount": 0,
  "completedAt": null,
  "players": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "hasSubmitted": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "hasSubmitted": false
    }
  ],
  "totalPlayers": 2,
  "submittedCount": 1
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Admins can see exactly who has and hasn't submitted rankings
2. **Communication**: Admins can follow up with specific players who haven't submitted
3. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded status makes it easy to scan the list
4. **Accessibility**: Proper table structure with ARIA labels for screen readers
5. **Responsive**: Works well on mobile and desktop devices

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with no players registered
2. Test with all players having submitted rankings
3. Test with some players having submitted and others pending
4. Test after draft is complete (table should not display)
5. Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
6. Test with screen reader for accessibility
