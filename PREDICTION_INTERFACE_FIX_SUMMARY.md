# Prediction Interface CSS Fix Summary

## Issue
The CSS refactoring removed the prediction interface styles, causing the "Make Predictions" page to look broken with unstyled contestant cards and layout issues.

## Root Cause
During the CSS refactoring, the prediction interface styles were not properly migrated to the new CSS architecture. The styles were lost, leaving the PredictionInterface component without proper styling.

## Solution
Added the missing prediction interface styles to the legacy CSS file (`frontend/src/styles/09-legacy.css`) as an emergency fix.

## Styles Added

### Core Prediction Interface Styles
- `.prediction-form` - Main form container
- `.instructions` - Instruction text styling
- `.tribes-container` - Container for all tribe sections
- `.tribe-section` - Individual tribe section styling
- `.tribe-section-title` - Tribe section headers
- `.tribe-instruction` - Instruction text for each tribe

### Contestant Card Styles
- `.contestant-cards-grid` - Grid layout for contestant cards
- `.contestant-prediction-card` - Individual contestant card styling
- `.contestant-prediction-card:hover` - Hover effects
- `.contestant-prediction-card.selected` - Selected state styling
- `.selected-indicator` - Checkmark for selected cards

### Interactive Elements
- `.clear-selection-btn` - Clear selection button
- `.submit-button` - Main submit button with hover/disabled states

### State-Specific Styles
- `.locked-message` - When predictions are locked
- `.locked-header` - Locked state header
- `.locked-icon` - Lock icon styling
- `.prediction-confirmation` - Confirmation after submission
- `.info-message` - Info message styling

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-responsive grid adjustments
- Smaller padding and font sizes on mobile
- Adjusted card layouts for smaller screens

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/styles/09-legacy.css` - Added all missing prediction interface styles

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: The prediction interface should now display correctly
2. **Short-term**: Move these styles from legacy CSS to proper component CSS files
3. **Long-term**: Create a dedicated `prediction-interface.css` component file

## Testing
The prediction interface should now display:
- Properly styled contestant cards in a grid layout
- Hover effects and selection states
- Responsive design on mobile devices
- Proper typography and spacing
- Functional submit button and clear selection buttons
