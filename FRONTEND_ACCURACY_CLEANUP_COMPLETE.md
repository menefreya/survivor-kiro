# Frontend Accuracy Cleanup - Complete

## Overview

Removed all player-facing accuracy tracking references from the frontend while keeping admin statistics functionality intact.

## Files Modified

### 1. PredictionHistory.jsx
**Removed:**
- `accuracy` state variable
- Accuracy statistics widget (circle with percentage)
- Accuracy details section (correct/incorrect/total counts)
- API call to fetch accuracy from `/predictions/history` response
- "Accuracy (Correct First)" sort option (changed to "Correct First")

**Changes:**
```jsx
// Before
const [accuracy, setAccuracy] = useState({ total: 0, correct: 0, percentage: 0 });
setAccuracy(response.data.accuracy || { total: 0, correct: 0, percentage: 0 });

// After
// Removed entirely
```

### 2. Profile.jsx
**Removed:**
- `predictionStats` state variable
- `loadingStats` state variable
- `fetchPredictionStats()` function
- API call to `/predictions/accuracy` endpoint
- Prediction Statistics section with accuracy display
- useEffect hook for fetching prediction stats

**Changes:**
```jsx
// Before
const fetchPredictionStats = async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/predictions/accuracy');
  setPredictionStats(response.data);
};

// After
// Removed entirely
```

### 3. PredictionResultsNotification.jsx
**Updated:**
- Changed text from "improve your accuracy" to "earn more points"

**Changes:**
```jsx
// Before
"Better luck next time! Keep making predictions to improve your accuracy."

// After
"Better luck next time! Keep making predictions to earn more points."
```

### 4. Predictions.css
**Removed:**
- `.accuracy-stats` styles
- `.accuracy-circle` styles
- `.accuracy-percentage` styles
- `.accuracy-label` styles
- `.accuracy-details` styles
- `.accuracy-stat` styles
- Responsive styles for accuracy widgets (tablet, mobile, print)

**Kept:**
- `.accuracy-visualization` (used by admin)
- `.accuracy-bar-*` (used by admin)
- `.accuracy-cell` (used by admin table)
- `.accuracy-value` (used by admin)

## What Still Works

### Player Features ✅
- View prediction history
- Filter predictions by episode/tribe
- Sort predictions by episode or correct first
- See individual prediction results
- See points earned (+3 for correct)

### Admin Features ✅
- View prediction statistics (still has accuracy)
- View accuracy by episode
- View overall accuracy percentage
- View participation rates
- All admin statistics functionality intact

## Admin vs Player Distinction

**Admin Statistics (`/predictions/statistics`):**
- ✅ Still exists and returns accuracy data
- ✅ Used by AdminPredictionStatistics component
- ✅ Shows overall accuracy, per-episode accuracy
- ✅ Calculated on-the-fly from database

**Player Accuracy (`/predictions/accuracy`):**
- ❌ Endpoint removed
- ❌ No longer displayed on profile
- ❌ No longer displayed on prediction history
- ❌ No longer displayed on dashboard

## Rationale

- **Admins** need accuracy stats to monitor game health and player engagement
- **Players** don't need accuracy tracking - they care about earning points
- Simplifies player experience while maintaining admin oversight
- Reduces API calls and frontend complexity

## CSS Cleanup Summary

**Removed (~80 lines):**
- Player-facing accuracy widget styles
- Accuracy circle/percentage styles
- Responsive styles for removed widgets

**Kept (~100 lines):**
- Admin statistics accuracy visualization
- Admin table accuracy cells
- Admin progress bars
