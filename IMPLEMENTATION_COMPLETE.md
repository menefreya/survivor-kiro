# Sole Survivor Auto-Selection Implementation - COMPLETE ✓

## Summary

Successfully implemented automatic sole survivor selection and per-player draft exclusion.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Auto-Select Sole Survivor (Frontend)
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/Ranking.jsx`
- **Behavior**: The #1 ranked contestant automatically becomes the sole survivor pick
- **Updates**: Real-time when rankings change via drag-and-drop or manual input
- **UI**: Replaced dropdown with display card showing current sole survivor

### 2. Per-Player Draft Exclusion (Backend)
- **File**: `backend/services/draftService.js`
- **Behavior**: Each player's sole survivor is excluded from their own draft picks only
- **Key Point**: Other players CAN still draft that contestant
- **Result**: Contestants can appear on multiple teams

## Key Implementation Details

### Frontend Logic
```javascript
// Auto-set sole survivor when rankings change
handleDrop() {
  // ... reorder contestants ...
  setSoleSurvivorId(newRanked[0].id.toString()); // #1 becomes sole survivor
}

handleRankChange() {
  // ... reorder contestants ...
  setSoleSurvivorId(newRanked[0].id.toString()); // #1 becomes sole survivor
}
```

### Backend Logic
```javascript
// Randomize player order for fair draft
const shufflePlayers = (array) => {
  const shuffled = [...array];
  for (let i = shuffled.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [shuffled[i], shuffled[j]] = [shuffled[j], shuffled[i]];
  }
  return shuffled;
};
const randomizedPlayers = shufflePlayers(players);

// Filter each player's rankings to exclude their own sole survivor
const playerRankings = {};
players.forEach(player => {
  playerRankings[player.id] = rankings
    .filter(r => r.player_id === player.id)
    .filter(r => r.contestant_id !== player.sole_survivor_id) // Per-player exclusion
    .map(r => r.contestant_id);
});

// Draft proceeds with randomized order - no global exclusion
// Each player can draft contestants that are other players' sole survivors
```

## Example: How It Works

### Setup
- 3 players
- 6 contestants (A, B, C, D, E, F)

### Rankings
- Player 1: [A, B, C, D, E, F] → Sole Survivor: A
- Player 2: [B, C, A, D, E, F] → Sole Survivor: B
- Player 3: [A, C, B, D, E, F] → Sole Survivor: A

### Draft Eligibility
- Player 1 can draft: [B, C, D, E, F] (excludes A)
- Player 2 can draft: [C, A, D, E, F] (excludes B)
- Player 3 can draft: [C, B, D, E, F] (excludes A)

### Draft Results (Snake Draft, 2 picks each)
**Round 1 (forward):**
- Player 1 picks B
- Player 2 picks C
- Player 3 picks B (taken) → gets D

**Round 2 (reverse):**
- Player 3 picks E
- Player 2 picks A ← Can draft A even though it's Player 1's sole survivor!
- Player 1 picks F

### Final Teams
- **Player 1**: A (sole survivor) + B (draft) + F (draft)
- **Player 2**: B (sole survivor) + C (draft) + A (draft)
- **Player 3**: A (sole survivor) + D (draft) + E (draft)

**Result**: Contestant A appears on 3 teams! Contestant B appears on 2 teams!

## Benefits

✅ **Simplified UX**: Users just rank contestants - #1 is automatically their sole survivor  
✅ **Fair Draft Order**: Random player order ensures no advantage based on signup time  
✅ **No Duplicates**: Players won't draft their own sole survivor  
✅ **Strategic Depth**: Popular contestants can appear on multiple teams  
✅ **Fair Competition**: Everyone has equal opportunity to draft any contestant (except their own sole survivor)  
✅ **Consistent Teams**: Each player always has exactly 3 contestants  

## Files Modified

### Code Changes

- ✅ `backend/services/draftService.js` - Per-player exclusion logic

### Documentation

## Testing Checklist

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Navigate to Ranking page
- [ ] Drag contestant to #1 position → Verify sole survivor updates
- [ ] Type rank "1" for a contestant → Verify sole survivor updates
- [ ] Submit rankings → Verify #1 contestant is saved as sole survivor

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Create 3 players with rankings
- [ ] Set Player 1 & 3 to have same sole survivor (e.g., Contestant A)
- [ ] Trigger draft
- [ ] Verify Player 1 & 3 did NOT draft Contestant A
- [ ] Verify Player 2 CAN draft Contestant A
- [ ] Verify each player has exactly 2 draft picks

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Complete end-to-end flow: signup → rank → draft → view team
- [ ] Verify sole survivor appears on team page
- [ ] Verify draft picks appear on team page
- [ ] Verify total of 3 contestants per player

## Edge Cases Handled

1. ✅ **No sole survivor set**: If null, all contestants eligible for draft
2. ✅ **Duplicate sole survivors**: Multiple players can have same sole survivor
3. ✅ **Shared contestants**: Contestants can be on multiple teams
4. ✅ **Rankings change**: Sole survivor updates in real-time
5. ✅ **Initial load**: First contestant auto-selected as sole survivor

## Database Schema

No changes required. Uses existing:
- `players.sole_survivor_id` - Stores sole survivor pick
- `rankings` table - Stores contestant rankings
- `draft_picks` table - Stores draft assignments

## API Endpoints

No changes required. Existing endpoints work with new logic:
- `POST /api/rankings` - Saves rankings with sole survivor
- `POST /api/draft/execute` - Executes draft with per-player exclusion
- `GET /api/players/:id` - Returns player with sole survivor

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Frontend**: Revert `Ranking.jsx` to restore manual dropdown
2. **Backend**: Remove sole survivor filter from `draftService.js`
3. **Database**: No changes needed (data remains valid)

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Add visual indicator in rankings list showing which contestant is sole survivor
2. Add confirmation dialog if user tries to submit without ranking
3. Show warning if sole survivor gets eliminated
4. Add animation when sole survivor changes
5. Display "shared contestants" indicator on team page

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All functionality implemented and documented. Ready for testing and deployment.
