# Sole Survivor Auto-Selection & Draft Exclusion

## Summary

Implemented automatic sole survivor selection and draft exclusion to streamline the ranking process and ensure sole survivor picks are protected.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend: Auto-Select Sole Survivor (Ranking.jsx)

**What Changed:**
- The #1 ranked contestant is automatically set as the sole survivor pick
- Removed manual dropdown selection for sole survivor
- Real-time updates when rankings change

**Key Updates:**
- `handleDrop()`: Auto-sets rank #1 contestant as sole survivor after drag-and-drop
- `handleRankChange()`: Auto-sets rank #1 contestant as sole survivor after manual rank input
- `fetchContestants()`: Auto-sets first contestant as sole survivor on initial load
- UI: Replaced dropdown with display card showing the #1 ranked contestant
- Removed: `handleSoleSurvivorChange()` function (no longer needed)

**User Experience:**
- Users rank contestants normally
- Whoever is in position #1 automatically becomes their sole survivor pick
- No separate selection step required
- Clear visual feedback showing current sole survivor

### 2. Backend: Exclude Sole Survivors from Own Draft (draftService.js)

**What Changed:**
- Draft algorithm now excludes each player's sole survivor from their own draft picks
- Each player's sole survivor is reserved for them (won't be drafted to them)
- Other players CAN still draft that contestant

**Key Updates:**
- Fetch `sole_survivor_id` when loading players
- Randomize player order using Fisher-Yates shuffle for fair draft
- Filter each player's rankings to exclude their own sole survivor
- Per-player exclusion (not global)

**Result:**
- Draft order is random (not based on signup order or player ID)
- Each player gets: 2 draft picks + 1 sole survivor = 3 total contestants
- A contestant can be both a sole survivor for one player AND a draft pick for another

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/Ranking.jsx` - Auto-selection logic and UI updates

### Backend
- `backend/services/draftService.js` - Draft exclusion logic

### Documentation
- `backend/docs/SOLE_SURVIVOR_DRAFT_EXCLUSION.md` - Implementation details and testing guide
- `SOLE_SURVIVOR_AUTO_SELECT_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing

### Frontend Testing
1. Navigate to the Ranking page
2. Drag contestants to reorder them
3. Verify the sole survivor card updates to show the #1 ranked contestant
4. Type a rank number to move a contestant
5. Verify the sole survivor updates accordingly

### Backend Testing
1. Create test players with rankings
2. Set sole survivors for each player
3. Trigger the draft
4. Verify draft picks exclude all sole survivor picks
5. Verify each player has exactly 2 draft picks

See `backend/docs/SOLE_SURVIVOR_DRAFT_EXCLUSION.md` for detailed testing steps.

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UX**: One less step for users - just rank contestants
2. **Logical Flow**: Your top choice is naturally your winner prediction
3. **Fair Draft**: Random player order ensures no advantage based on signup time
4. **No Duplicates**: You won't draft your own sole survivor
5. **Strategic Depth**: Popular contestants can appear on multiple teams
6. **Consistent Teams**: Each player always has 3 contestants (2 draft + 1 sole survivor)

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No sole survivor set**: If `sole_survivor_id` is null, all contestants are eligible for draft
2. **Rankings not submitted**: Draft validation still requires all players to submit rankings
3. **Insufficient contestants**: Draft will fail with clear error if not enough contestants available
4. **Rank changes**: Sole survivor updates immediately when #1 position changes

## Backward Compatibility

- Database schema unchanged (uses existing `sole_survivor_id` column)
- API endpoints unchanged
- Existing sole survivor picks remain valid
- Draft algorithm enhancement is transparent to API consumers

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Allow manual override of sole survivor (with confirmation)
2. Show warning if #1 ranked contestant is eliminated
3. Highlight sole survivor in rankings list
4. Add animation when sole survivor changes
